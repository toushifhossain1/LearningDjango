Django is a back-end server side web framework.

Django is free, open source and written in Python.

Django makes it easier to build web pages using Python.

Django emphasizes reusability of components, also refereed to as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and comes with ready-to-use features like login system, database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).

# Django is especially helpful for database driven websites.


Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).

Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.
